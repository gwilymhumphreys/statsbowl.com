    <br />
    <div><b>5. Purchases</b></div>
    <div>Paid Services (“Premium Services”) are available to certain users of the website.</div>
    <div>If you purchase any of our paid Services (“Premium Services”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes. Failure to pay these fees may result in the termination of your subscription. Also:</div>
    <div> • Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).</div>
    <div> • You authorise us to store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your service (e.g. subscriptions) and to facilitate easy payment for new services.</div>
    <div> • You must pay us for applicable fees and taxes unless you cancel the Premium Service, in which case you agree to still pay these fees through the end of the applicable subscription period. </div>
    <div> • Taxes are calculated based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase.</div>
    <div> • Your Premium Services may be cancelled by us at any as a result of your breeching these Terms.</div>
    <br />
    <div>To cancel your Premium Services by contacting us at hello@statsbowl.com. </div>
    <br />
    <div>Generally, all fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. Except as noted here, all paid products including Premium Account subscriptions, Ads or Game Postings are nonrefundable after purchase and delivery.</div>
    <div>An exception we may consider is providing a refund when we've updated your payment information and there are good reasons to believe that you did not intend for an update to be made.</div>
    <br />
    <div>Also, under the laws applicable in your jurisdiction, Premium Account subscribers may qualify for a refund if requested during a short period of time after the beginning of the subscription. For example, citizens of the European Union are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days after the subscription begins. Please note that this 14 day period commences when the subscription service starts, which in the event of free trial promotions happens before you are first charged, and so there may be no fees paid to be refunded.</div>
    <div>Note: All of your Premium features expire as soon as your cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing cycle, so make sure you use all your entitlements before your account is canceled.</div>
    <div>Order confirmations will be send via email and you may request an invoice by contacting hello@statsbowl.com.</div>
